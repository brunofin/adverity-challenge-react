# Advertising Data ETL-V

The goal is to provide a simple dashboard, that shows those metrics for given regular dimension
values (as user input) over time.

## React Frontend only

Use react with
• create-react-app to bootstrap your application
• with a proper design of your components
• react hooks to manage state and side effects
• lodash to transform your data
• an idiomatic functional programming approach with javascript / es6
to implement the entire application as a pure frontend application - that fetches the data, does the
heavy computation and visualizes the result.
